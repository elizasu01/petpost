# petpost
SFWRTECH 4CL3 – Cloud Computing - Project
Scenario: 
A small animal rescue group wants a basic website where volunteers can post information about adoptable pets. They don’t need a full database or complex features—just a simple form to add a pet (name, breed, age, photo) and a page that shows all pets currently available. The website must be hosted on AWS, be affordable, and work with a small team of volunteers.
